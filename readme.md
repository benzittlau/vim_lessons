# Vim Lessons

## Getting Started

To start learning VIM, go ahead and clone this repo and open up a lesson in vim.

To open a given lesson type `vi <lesson>.markdown`.  Markdown was used to write these lessons simply to provide some form of syntax highlighting to the content when it is viewed in VIM.  If you have any suggestions for other formats that would be better suited for these lessons please feel free to contact me and suggest them, or create an issue on this repo.

All lessons are intended to be interactive, trying to take advantage of the 'learn by doing' approach which I think is well suited to the muscle memory based nature of vim.

## License

These lessons are under the MIT license simply because it is the most open license I'm familiar with.
